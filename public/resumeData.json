    "bio": "I am a Senior Technology Leader with 12+ years of experience transforming regulated fintech environments into modern, cloud-native, API-first ecosystems. Iâ€™ve partnered with leading banks and fintech firms to deliver enterprise-scale digital transformationsâ€”accelerating time-to-market by 40% and unlocking multimillion-pound revenue growth within months.\n\nAs Director of Technology at FCamara UK and Interim Principal Engineer for Birmingham Bank, Iâ€™ve led the architecture and launch of fully digital savings and lending platforms. This included migrating legacy infrastructure to Mambu and Azure, enabling AI-driven MFA, and implementing biometric KYC/KYB processes. These initiatives onboarded 5,600+ customers, grew deposit accounts by 225%, automated 19,000+ transactions, and processed Â£295M+ in digital paymentsâ€”all while maintaining 99.9% uptime and ensuring PCI DSS, GDPR, and FS compliance.\n\nIâ€™ve built and mentored high-performing teams of 25+ professionals, advised executive committees, and shaped global delivery strategies across the UK, Brazil, and Portugal. My expertise spans enterprise architecture (microservices, event-driven systems, DDD), digital product innovation, and operational resilienceâ€”underpinned by deep technical leadership in Azure, AWS, .NET Core, DevOps, and secure financial integrations.\n\nDriven by a passion for technology and strategic impact, I focus on aligning engineering excellence with business growthâ€”delivering scalable solutions and empowering teams to innovate in highly regulated markets.\n\nðŸ’¡ And despite all the leadership titlesâ€¦ Iâ€™m still a developer at heartâ€”often found scratching my head over complex code just like day one.",
